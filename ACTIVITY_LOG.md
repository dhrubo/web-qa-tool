# Activity Log Feature

## Overview
Added real-time activity log that shows detailed progress updates during screenshot capture, making it transparent what the system is doing during long wait times.

## Problem Solved
Users reported that screenshot generation takes a long time with no visibility into what's happening. They could see detailed logs in the console but not in the UI, leading to uncertainty about whether the process was stuck or progressing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Progress Callback in Screenshot Functions**
Modified both `takeScreenshots()` and `takeDesktopScreenshots()` to accept an optional `onProgress` callback:

```typescript
export async function takeScreenshots(
  page: Page, 
  url: string,
  onProgress?: (message: string) => void
): Promise<{...}>
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging with Emojis**
Added descriptive messages with visual emojis at each step:

```typescript
const log = (msg: string) => {
  console.log(msg);
  if (onProgress) onProgress(msg);
};

log(`📄 Navigating to original URL (desktop)...`);
log(`⏳ Scrolling page and waiting 30s for images to load...`);
log(`📸 Taking desktop original screenshot...`);
log(`⏳ [ALPHA] Performing aggressive scroll (50s) to load lazy images...`);
log(`✅ Screenshot generation complete!`);
```

### 3. **API Progress Forwarding**
API creates progress callback that sends SSE status events:

```typescript
const progressCallback = (message: string) => {
  sendEvent(res, 'status', { message });
};

const visualDiffResult = await takeScreenshots(page, url, progressCallback);
```

### 4. **Frontend Activity Log**
Added scrollable activity log component that displays all status updates:

```typescript
const [activityLog, setActivityLog] = useState<string[]>([]);

// Updates activity log with timestamp
setActivityLog(prev => {
  const newLog = [...prev, `${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}: ${message}`];
  return newLog.slice(-20); // Keep last 20 messages
});
```

### 5. **Auto-Scroll**
Log automatically scrolls to show latest activity:

```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  if (activityLogRef.current) {
    activityLogRef.current.scrollTop = activityLogRef.current.scrollHeight;
  }
}, 100);
```

## Activity Log Messages

## Benefits

### Before
- ❌ No visibility during long waits
- ❌ Users unsure if process was stuck
- ❌ Had to check browser console
- ❌ Anxiety during 50s delays

### After
- ✅ Real-time progress updates
- ✅ Know exactly what's happening
- ✅ See wait times for each step
- ✅ Confidence process is working
- ✅ Emojis make it visually appealing
- ✅ Console-like log for tech users

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

1. **lib/screenshot.ts**
   - Added `onProgress` callback parameter to both functions
   - Created `log()` helper that calls console + callback
   - Added emoji icons to all status messages
   - Shows exact wait times in messages

2. **pages/api/qa-stream.ts**
   - Created `progressCallback` function
   - Passes callback to screenshot functions
   - Forwards all progress to SSE stream

3. **app/page.tsx**
   - Added `activityLog` state (string array)
   - Added `activityLogRef` for auto-scroll
   - Updates log on each status message
   - Renders scrollable log component
   - Limits to last 20 messages
   - Auto-scrolls to bottom

## Technical Details

### Message Flow
```
Screenshot Function (lib/screenshot.ts)
  ↓ log("📄 Navigating...")
Progress Callback
  ↓ onProgress("📄 Navigating...")
API Handler (pages/api/qa-stream.ts)
  ↓ sendEvent(res, 'status', { message: "📄 Navigating..." })
SSE Stream
  ↓ EventSource receives status event
Frontend (app/page.tsx)
  ↓ onUpdate({ type: 'status', data: { message: "..." } })
Activity Log State
  ↓ setActivityLog([...prev, "15:23:45: 📄 Navigating..."])
UI Render
  ↓ Scrollable log displays all messages
```

### Performance
- **Minimal overhead**: Only string concatenation
- **Memory efficient**: Keeps max 20 messages
- **No blocking**: Updates asynchronous
- **Auto-cleanup**: Old messages dropped

## User Experience Impact

### Transparency
Users now see:
- What URL is being loaded
- When scrolling happens
- How long waits are
- Which screenshot is being taken
- When operations complete

### Reduced Anxiety
- Clear indication progress is happening
- Countdown timer + activity log = double reassurance
- Know exactly when things will complete
- No more wondering if it's frozen

### Professional Feel
- Console-like interface appeals to developers
- Emojis add visual interest
- Timestamps show real-time updates
- Monospace font = technical credibility

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export Log**: Download activity log as text file
2. **Filter Messages**: Toggle verbose/summary mode
3. **Progress Percentage**: Show % complete per step
4. **Color Coding**: Different colors for different message types
5. **Collapsible**: Hide/show log to save space
6. **Screenshot Previews**: Inline thumbnails as they complete

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test single-alpha mode - verify all 14+ messages appear
- [ ] Test multi-desktop mode - verify 7+ messages per URL
- [ ] Check auto-scroll works (always shows latest)
- [ ] Verify timestamps are accurate
- [ ] Confirm emojis display correctly
- [ ] Test with multiple URLs (log should update for each)
- [ ] Check message limit (max 20 shown)
- [ ] Verify log clears on new run

## Summary

**What Changed**: Added real-time activity log showing detailed progress during screenshot capture

**Why**: Users couldn't see what was happening during long delays (30-50 seconds)

**How**: Screenshot functions send progress updates via callback → API forwards via SSE → Frontend displays in scrollable log

**Result**: Complete transparency into screenshot process with timestamps, emojis, and auto-scroll ✅
